	    	    <h2>Internet vs. World Wide Web</h2>
	    	    <p>Before discussing further the history of the Internet, let's first differentiate it from the world wide web.
	    	    The <b>Internet</b> is a massive network of networks. This is what connects millions of computers
	    	    together globally, and the exchange of information is between the internet themselves. This information
	    	    travels over the Internet via a variety of languages known as protocols. The <b>World Wide Web</b> on the other hand, is just a part
	    	    of the massive Internet structure. It is a way of accessing information over the Internet and uses the <b>Hyper Text Transfer
	    	    Protocol</b> or <b>HTTP</b> to transmit data. The Web uses different web services, like browsers, e-mails and websites to disseminate
	    	    information.</p>
	    	    
	    	    <h2>The First Usage of the Term "Internet"</h2>
	    	    
	    	    <p>The term “internetworking” and its abbreviation, “internet” was then used interchangeably coming from RFC 675: Internet
	    	    Transmission Control Program of December 1974. It was later on used as the name of the network, Internet, when ARPANET linked
	    	    with NSFNET during the late 1980’s. Internet back then was defined as any network using TCP/IP. The Internet then continued to
	    	    grow and spread throughout the rest of the world as the need for networking grew. </p>
	    	    
	    	    <h2>How did the Internet Start?</h2>
	    	    
	    	    <p>In 1970, ARPANET machines five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 and 12 were operating at locations around the country,
	    	    including those at a Network Control Center at the technology corporation Bolt Beranek & Newman, at Harvard, the RAND
	    	    Corporation and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. File-Transfer Protocol (FTP) - the method for allowing
	    	    computers to exchange files, was posted as RFC 354 in July 1972. The ARPANET went on public display for the first time at
	    	    the International Conference on Computer Communication in October 1972. The first electronic mail delivery engaging two machines
	    	    was accomplished in 1972 by Ray Tomlinson - also the originator of the use of the @ to indicate an e-mail address. By 1973,
	    	    three-quarters of all traffic on the network was e-mail - still mostly researchers sharing information. An e-mail list group
	    	    of the time named MsgGroup is believed to have been the first "virtual community." The scientists had been using Network Control
	    	    Protocol (NCP) to transfer data from one computer to another running on the same network. Vinton Cerf of UCLA and Stanford and
	    	    Robert Kahn from ARPA came up with the ideas for Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) over a span
	    	    during the mid- to late-1970s. The superior TCP/IP allowed diverse computers networks to interconnect and communicate with one
	    	    another no matter what network they were on at the time of use. TCP/IP made the internet faster and more efficient; it was thus
	    	    possible to bring more computers online at a lower price. This fueled the growth of the internet.</p>
	    	    
	    	    <p>In 1976, Robert Metcalfe developed Ethernet, which allowed data to be transferred at rapid speeds over coaxial cables.
	    	    Soon after, a packet satellite project (SATNET) that used satellites to link the United States with Europe was completed,
	    	    thus a basic worldwide data-delivery universe was born. Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign staff sent out e-mail several
	    	    times a day in the fall of 1976, earning him the descriptor "computer-driven candidate." In 1979, Kevin MacKenzie, a member
	    	    of the MsgGroup e-mail list, complained about the "loss of meaning," the lack of facial expressions, vocal inflection and gestures
	    	    in e-mail correspondence. He suggested the use of a new form of punctuation in e-mails and used the example -). This was far less
	    	    sophisticated than the :o) and many other emoticons in use today. MacKenzie was flamed (criticized) by the other people in the
	    	    e-mail group at the time, but his legacy lives on. At this stage in its development, few people outside the research community
	    	    used the internet.</p>
	    	    
	    	    <p>The National Science Foundation started the Computer Science Research Network (CSNET) and had more than 70 sites online by
	    	    1983. In the mid-'80s, a coordinating group called the Internet Activities Board centralized networking efforts; late in the
	    	    decade its membership numbered in the hundreds, and it was split into two groups, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
	    	    and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). By 1986, most U.S. computer science departments were connected through this method,
	    	    paying the NSF annual operation fees in order to use the network. More networks emerged, including BITNET, USENET and UUCP.
	    	    In 1985, NSFNET, a "backbone" to connect five supercomputer centers located all over the United States, allowed the establishment
	    	    of regional networks around the country, making a brighter, more-connected future possible for more people. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee,
	    	    a researcher at CERN, the particle physics laboratory in Geneva, wrote a memo to his supervisors suggesting his ideas for the
	    	    invention of a worldwide network that would revolutionize everything.</p>
	    	    
	    	    <p>And by 1990, Tim Berners-Lee gave life to his "World Wide Web" idea.</p>

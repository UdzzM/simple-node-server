	    	    <h2>TCP/IP, SMTP, FTP and HTTP</h2>
	    	    <p>Dating back from the 70’s and 80’s, it’s quite predictable that most of what the Internet has become now was
	    	    not incorporated in the original design. Changes happened, improvisations and innovations too, which led to what
	    	    it is today—a “global multimedia and information system” which connects a single individual with almost the whole
	    	    wide world in just one click. As opposed to its initial objective which is to connect mainstream computers, the original
	    	    inventors may not have foreseen what their device made solely for timesharing purposes could do today. Let’s take a flashback
	    	    on how its core systems evolved.</p>
	    	    
	    	    <p>The <b>Domain Name System</b> is the mother of all systems. It may be similar to a librarian. A borrower would ask the
	    	    librarian on what the title of the book is, the librarian looks it up on his files, then send the borrower to that
	    	    section of books. It is the same as the DNS. The user enters a subject, then the Internet would know on which number
	    	    it would send the query by looking up at the Domain Name System. It is the one that maps the numbers to different websites
	    	    (e.g. www.yahoo.com, www. google.com) The DNS was established in the year 1984.</p>
	    	    
	    	    <p><b>WHOIS</b>, given the name, is the database which the main objective is to give details about a certain user. It
	    	    was named after a UNIX command, whois, which serves the same purpose. It may be thought of as the “phonebook” database.
	    	    Back in the days, there were no privacy laws or privacy issues that existed and that caused controversy nowadays as
	    	    certain details that is meant to be kept private are abused due to the database’s openness for public usage.</p>
	    	    
	    	    <p>One of the problems the Internet faces today is that it uses a system called <b>ASCII</b>, which stands for <b>American
	    	    Standard Code for Information Interchange</b>. As much as the 80% of the population whose primary language is not English
	    	    wants to use the Internet to communicate, it seems unsuitable to do so. Yes, it currently works for, say, Filipinos,
	    	    but the problem emerges for the Japanese and the Arabic, mainly because of the ACSII.</p>
	    	    
	    	    <p>The <b>Transmission Control Protocol – Internet Protocol</b> defines what the Internet is. It may be compared to a
	    	    mailman as its main job is to transport different data into the systems across the internet. This protocol would
	    	    work on any sort of computer and operating systems but during the 1980’s, it faced its first big problem. It was
	    	    foreseen that the numbering system would run out of numbers soon. After five years of work, TCP/IP Vs 6 was created
	    	    to resolve the trouble. </p>
	    	    
	    	    <p><b>SMTP</b>, or <b>the Simple Message Transfer Protocol</b>, is the basic standard for email, and again exists since
	    	    the 1980s when the Internet was small and honest. Perhaps more than any other system on the Internet, email has seen a
	    	    number of improvements and different protocols, each of which has been adopted by only part of the Internet email
	    	    community. This capacity not to adopt standards is a feature of the Internet, making dealing with change more difficult
	    	    than it otherwise might be.</p>
	    	    
	    	    <p>Another important protocol which dates from pre 1972 is <b>FTP</b>, or the <b>File Transfer Protocol</b>. This simply is
	    	    the way to upload or download a file from an Internet computer. Just about everyone who owns a website uses this one. With
	    	    the coming of the World Wide Web, we see another powerful protocol - <b>HTTP</b>, or <b>HyperText Transfer Protocol</b>.
	    	    HTTP allows us to click on the name of a site and visit it. Simple, but very powerful.</p>

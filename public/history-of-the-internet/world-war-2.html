	    	    <h2>Sputnik, USSR, and the Birth of the Internet</h2>
	    	    <p>The Soviets have seemed to outwin even the most brilliant inventors and innovators during the 50’s.
	    	    As the giddy Americans focused on how to better their cars or improve television sets, the Soviets were scheming on
	    	    something that was more sensible – concocting Sputnik, the world’s first manmade satellite. October 4, 1957, thus the
	    	    birth of triumph over Cold War.</p>
	    	    <p>And just as how some of us have grandfathers who fought during the war, ARPAnet, grandfather to the Internet,
	    	    contributed as much too. Communication between the military was very confidential that a protocol called Network
	    	    Control Protocol was developed. They exchanged messages via the NCP, in which ARPAnet guarded the flow of information.</p>
	    	    <p>This generation is lucky enough to send as much data as they want to because way back in 1969, Internet’s grandfather
	    	    sent its first one word message via “node-to-node” communicaton but the system crashed. The word was “LOGIN” and
	    	    unfortunately only “LO” was received.</p>
	    	    <p>On 1969, only four computers were connected to ARPAnet, one was installed in a research lab in UCLA, and one located
	    	    in Stanford. On 1970’s, three more computers added: University of Hawaii’s ALOHAnet followed by London’s University
	    	    College and Norway’s the Royal Radar Establishment. The networks grew steady but it was difficult to put them together as one.</p>
	    	    <p>Vinton Cerf, a computer scientist, later found a solution to this dilemma as he  discovered “Transmission Control
	    	    Protocol” in which one writer described simply as “the ‘threeway handshake’ that introduces distant and different
	    	    computers to each other in a virtual space.” Later on, Cerf added an “Internet Protocol” to TCP which is used nowadays as TCP/IP.</p>

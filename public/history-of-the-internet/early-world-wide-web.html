	    	    <h2>Timmy's Web</h2>
	    	    <p>The creation of “The World Wide Web” during the 90’s didn’t actually capture anyone’s attention. Though this
	    	    might be the case, still, physicists Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Caillaiu continued on with their vision which is
	    	    “to combine hypertext with the internet to create web pages”. This later on to grow into developing the web’s three major
	    	    components namely HTTP, HTML and the web browser.</p>
	    	    
	    	    <p>The World Wide Web started out as private use, specifically in CERN. It was on August 6, 1991 that it was opened
	    	    to public as Berners-Lee invited collaborators for his project. He did this by posting a short summary of his project
	    	    in alt.hypertext newsgroup.</p>
	    	    
	    	    <p>As the years go by, more and more browsers were created. Each of which has its own unique features which aided in
	    	    the progress of the World Wide Web.
	    	    -Line Mode Browser - feb 1992. This was also brought to us by Berners Lee. It was the first browser to support
	    	    multiple platforms.
				-Viola WWW Browser released - march 1992. This is widely suggested to be the world's first popular browser. It brought with it
				a stylesheet and scripting language, long before JavaScript and CSS.
				-Mosaic Browser released - Jan 5th 1993. Mosaic was really highly rated when it first came out. It was developed at University
				of Illinois.
				-Cello Browser released - June 8th, 1993. This was the first browser available for Windows.
				-Netscape Navigator 1.1 released - March 1995. This was the first browser to introduce tables to HTML.
				-Opera 1.0 released - April 1995. This was originally a research project for a Norwegian telephone company. The browser is still
				available today and is currently at version 12.
				-Internet Explorer 1.0 released - August 1995. Microsoft decided to get in on the act when its Windows operating system '95 was
				released. This was the browser that ran exclusively on that.</p>
	    	    
	    	    <p>On August 19, 1995, JavaScript or originally known as ‘Mocha’ was announced to the public, together with Brendan Eich’s
	    	    browser Netscape Navigator 2. This attempt was not supported by many, including Robert Cailliau who worked with Tim on WWW.
	    	    Despite these, JavaScript carried on and is known nowadays to help web pages be dynamic and interactive to people. Way back,
	    	    web pages were only simple text documents. It is through the aid of JavaScript and CSS that we have such applications that we
	    	    have now.</p>
	    	    
	    	    <p>Cascading style sheets or also known as CSS are responsible for the look of web pages. It is also in charge of separating
	    	    the document content (HTML) and the web pages’ appearance.  The first attempt of using it was in 1995 (though it have been
	    	    around in some shape during the 80’s) when CSS1 was launched but had trouble as it wouldn’t work with other browsers. It was
	    	    March 2000 that a browser Internet 5 explorer, was released and it was compatible with CSS1. It received official recommendation
	    	    by W3C in 1996.</p>

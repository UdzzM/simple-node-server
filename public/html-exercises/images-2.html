        <h1>Harry Potter Boy Muggle</h1>

            <p>I was actually Harry Potter when I was a child. But when my Hogwarts letter didn't come in the mail via Hedwig, my Harry Potter Boy Wizard
            look faded and I ended up looking more and more a muggle as I grew older.</p>

            <p>As I continued living in the muggle world, I was forced to enroll in a muggle school because my Hogwarts letter apparently got lost along
            with Hedwig. I decided to engage in sports instead and won the Basketball Championships along with my teammates (though it would have been
            better if the Quidditch Championship Cup was what I was holding)</p>

            <p>After years of waiting, my letter finally came! Though it may not be from Hogwarts, it's the next best thing here in the muggle world - a
             letter from UP stating that I have passed the dreaded UPCAT! 3 years after I received that letter, here I am now, spreading unicorn poop in UPLB
             and turning beer into water. (and occasionally irritating my dog, Bart)</p>

            <p>Hopefully, after a few years, I can transform myself into a duck and swim in pools of treasure. Kidding aside, I do hope that I be known in
            my field which is writing and make loads of money along the way. Because, let's be honest, money can buy me happiness. It's hard to cry while
            inside a Bugatti Veyron or Lamborghini Egoista.</p>

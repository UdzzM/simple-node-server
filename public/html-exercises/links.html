        <h2>Top Picks: A Blog of my Bests and Greatests</h2>
        <p><em>My Top 3 Movie Picks</em></p>
        <p>The third spot goes to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105417/">Sister Act.</a> It is about a Las Vegas Showgirl who was forced to hide in a convent and dress as a nun in order to hide from her mobster boyfriend.
        The movie is funny and the songs are catchy, and with Whoopi Goldberg's great acting, this definitely deserves the number 3 spot.</p>
        
        <p>The second spot goes to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/">Casablanca.</a> Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman have a chemistry that glues your eyes to the screen. 
        And with Casablanca being the archetype for modern unconditional love movies, I am proud that this is in the second spot.</p>
        
        <p>And finally, the number one spot goes to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201607/">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2!</a> Finally, the story of the boy who lived is coming to a close.
        The final battle between Voldemort and Harry launches this movie to the number 1 spot!</p>

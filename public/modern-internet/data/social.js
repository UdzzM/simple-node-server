The earliest form of social networking was the Bulletin Board System or BBS in 1978. But it was painstakingly slow, as it only allowed one user at a time to be logged in. It was in 1979 that a virtual newsletter allowed users to communicate - it was UseNet. The earliest form of instant messaging came into computers by the year 1988. Internet Relay Chat was limited to most people as is was Unix-based and was mostly used for link and file sharing. ICQ soon followed in the mid 90s, and it was the first instant messaging program for PCs. It was partly responsible for the adoption of avatars, abbreviations and emoticons. In 1994, Geocities went online and was one of the first social networking sites. In 1995, TheGlobe.com was launched, it allowed users to publish their own content. AOL Instant Messenger and SixDegrees.com were launched in 1997. They allowed users to creat a profile and be friends. LiveJournal, which was launched in 1999, consisted of constantly-updated blogs and allowed the creation of groups. The 21st century saw the developments of social networks, starting with the launching of Friendster in 2002, which acquired 3 million users within its first 3 months. It also served as the launching point for MySpace, which allowed users to customize the look of their profiles. The following year, LinkedIn was founded. It was one of the first social network dedicated to business. Come 2004, the then Harvard-only social network was founded - Facebook. By 2006, it expanded to allow everyone on the web to sign up. And by 2008, it became the most popular social networking site. It allowed users to post photos, videos and post on each other's walls. In 2006, one of the first microblogging sites was launched. Twitter allowed users to only 140 characters per post. Tumblr, which was launched in 2007, was a cross between a lifestreaming application and a microblogging platform. There are a lot more social networks out on the web. These are just some of the social networking sites that helped shape social media as we know today.";

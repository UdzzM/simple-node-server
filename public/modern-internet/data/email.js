document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = "One of the earliest internet service was the email. But how does it really work? The outdated snail mail and email have a lot in common, except that email is, well, electronic. After we composed our email, we send it to our recipient. Now this is where the fun starts. Our email client sends it to an email server via SMTP, then that server checks to whom we are sending it. If we are send to example@yahoo.com, the server looks up yahoo.com and send it there. Once it reaches its destination, SMTP works its magic and put the message in the mailbox of our recipient. Server mailbox =/= recipient's mailbox. Our recipient's email client collects the mail from the server mailbox and delivers it to his inbox with the help of POP or IMAP. And that's it. Our email finally arrived at its destination.";

Well, on the 1st of January, 1983, ARPANET switched from the Network Control Protocol(NCP) to TCP/IP, thus marking the birth of the modern internet. But it still wasn't available for the public to use freely as we do now. Instead, the Internet back then was still used for military and academic affairs. Let's fast forward to 1991, to the creation of the World Wide Web and the first web page. The Web made surfing the Internet easier with HTML, HTTP and URLs. The year 1991 was also the birth of the first search protocol - Gopher. And in 1993, Mosaic was up and running and was quite famous back then. Mosiac was the first graphical wab browser. By 1995, Mosaic already had a competitor, the Netscape Navigator, the Internet was starting to be commercialized, the White House and the United Nations became online, marking the birth of .org and .gov. But that's not all, Ebay and Amazon were also founded in the year 1995, and Geocities and the Vatican went online on the same year. And these are just some highlights. All these happened in a short period of time, which makes us think what new technological advancement will happen in the next 5 years. But before we talk about the future, I'll tell you more about the humble beginnings of the Modern Internet and some of its components and features that we enjoy today.

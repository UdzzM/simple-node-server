No, it's not a car having damaged tires, that was the name of the band ever to have a first live gig on the internet, and they weren't your typical garage band. They are composed of computer technologists from DEC, XEROX, Apple and Sun. It was followed in 1995 by a live audio event by RealNetworks - a baseball game between the Yankees and Seattle mariners. The following year, Microsoft developed the ActiveMovie media player which allowed media streaming and has its own streaming format. In 1997, RealNetworks answered by releasing their owm streaming application. And in 1999, Apple joined the streaming wars by releasing its own streaming format - Quicktime 4. In 2000, video streaming was difficult as there was no dominant format, thus requiring users to download all applications needed for streaming. But Microsoft emerged as the winner with Windows Media. Its success was shortlived as Flash Player's popularity rose. In 2005, the website that has become synonymous with online videos was founded - Youtube. In 2007, Move Networks introduced an HTTP-based adaptive streaming while eliminated buffering and connectivity issues. Microsoft, Netflix, Apple and Adobe soon developed their own HTTP-based adaptive streaming, being a top choice for live streaming events.";

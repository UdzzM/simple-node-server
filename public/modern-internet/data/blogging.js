document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = "Blogging has been around for a short period of time, with Links.net being recognized as the first blog and Justin Hall being the creator of it. But it wasn't called blog back then. It was merely a homepage. It wasn't until 1997 that 'weblog' was coined by John Barger as short for 'logging the web'. And in 1999, programmer Peter Merholz shortened in to 'blog'. It was also in 1999 that LiveJournal was founded. We call the site today as Blogger. Blogger made blogging mainstream. By the 2000s decade, the number of blogs were growing exponentially, from 23 blogs in 1999 to 50 million blogs by the year 2006. WordPress, one of the most popular blogging platform today, was founded in 2003. And by 2005, blogging was going mainstream, with Garrett M. Graff being granted White House press credentials. That was the first time that a blogger was granted with that. And mainstream news sources were soon eyeing the idea of blogging for their content, with news sources teaming up with existing blogs for additional coverage and commentary. Soon, almost every news source have their own blog, even companies have a blog of their own.";
